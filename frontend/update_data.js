    description: 'A Concrete Lithium Densifier & Hardener is a premium water-based chemical treatment formulated with lithium silicate. It is applied to cured concrete floors, where it penetrates deep into the concrete pores and chemically reacts with free lime (calcium hydroxide) to form Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H). This permanent reaction strengthens the concrete from within, eliminates dusting, improves abrasion resistance, and enhances the floor\\\\'s ability to achieve a high-gloss polish.',
