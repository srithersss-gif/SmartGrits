    description: `The SmartGrits Microfiber Dry Mop is an essential finishing and maintenance tool for polished concrete floors. Designed for dry application, it efficiently collects fine dust, loose particles, and surface debris without the need for water or chemical agents — making it perfect for both pre-polishing preparation and post-polishing maintenance.

The microfiber pad technology generates a static charge that actively attracts and traps fine particles, preventing them from being redistributed across the floor surface. With a surface area several times greater than conventional cotton mops, it covers large industrial floor areas in fewer passes, improving productivity and floor cleanliness.`,

    description: `Lithium Silicate Densifier & Hardener is a premium, penetrating chemical treatment engineered to permanently increase the density, hardness, and abrasion resistance of concrete floors. When applied to the concrete surface, the lithium silicate solution penetrates deep into the substrate and reacts chemically with free lime (calcium hydroxide) to form Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) — the same compound that gives concrete its structural strength.

Unlike sodium silicate-based products, lithium silicate formulations produce a significantly smaller molecular structure that penetrates deeper into the concrete, delivers faster chemical reactivity, and leaves minimal surface residue. The result is a permanently hardened, dust-free, and highly polishable concrete surface.`,

    description: `Sodium Silicate Densifier & Hardener, commonly known as water glass, is a proven, cost-effective chemical hardener used to improve the strength, durability, and dust resistance of concrete floors. It penetrates the concrete surface and reacts with free calcium hydroxide (lime) to form Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) — the primary compound responsible for concrete's compressive strength.

The newly formed C-S-H crystals fill microscopic pores and capillary channels within the concrete matrix, creating a permanently denser, harder surface. Since the reaction occurs inside the concrete, the treatment becomes an integral part of the slab and will not peel, chip, or flake like surface coatings.`,

    description: `SmartGrits Concrete Sealer is a high-performance protective treatment designed to safeguard concrete surfaces from moisture, water penetration, oils, chemicals, salts, and other contaminants. By sealing the surface pores or penetrating deep into the concrete structure, it significantly improves durability, reduces maintenance requirements, and extends the service life of concrete floors.

Concrete sealers help prevent cracking, dusting, staining, efflorescence, spalling, freeze-thaw damage, and chemical deterioration, while maintaining the appearance and structural integrity of the concrete.

SmartGrits offers two main sealer types — Penetrating Sealers (silane, siloxane, lithium silicate) that protect from within without forming a film, and Film-Forming Sealers (acrylic, polyurethane, epoxy) that create a surface coating for superior stain and chemical resistance with an enhanced gloss finish.`,
